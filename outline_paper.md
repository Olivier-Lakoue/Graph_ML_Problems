#### AI controlled traffic networks

Experiments evaluating reinforcement 
learning approaches in traffic flow regulation.
We first need to define a minimal traffic network 
presenting congestion problems.
We will then produce an initial dataset to evaluate if
network congestion is predictable by machine learning.
Finally, reinforcement learning will be tested on a simple
network.
We will discuss about scaling up this experiment 
for real networks.

##### Introduction
__What is traffic congestion ?__
* congestion is the number of actors passing through a point
in a defined time window.
* The main causes are overflows, accidents and road works.

__Why traffic congestion ?__
It is a complex system problem with no definitive solution.
Negative impacts: wasting time, delays, wasted fuel, 
air pollution, vehicles maintenance, human health, emergency 
services, real estate price.
Economic loss: NYC (33.7 M$, 8,6m pop, 784km2), 
LA (19.2 M$, 3.98m pop, 1210 km2),
 SF (10.6M$, 0.884m pop, 121.4 km2)
Natural networks, such as biological or ecological networks exists
suggesting that regulation mechanisms discovered in nature could
help us design better traffic regulation.

__What is reinforcement learning ?__
A probabilistic algorithm able to make decisions in a changing
environment. Making decisions to adjust a behaviour in regard to
recent events is a human perk. Bringing computers close to 
human intelligence by replicating this behaviour artificially.

__Why reinforcement learning ?__
There is no definitive theoretical model able to predict and 
regulate traffic flow. We thus need empirical predictive model
to help us design regulatory mechanisms.
Recent advances in deep-learning allowed reinforcement learning 
researchers to obtain spectacular results.
